## Inspiration

I loved the minimalism of this layout and the vibrancy of the colors. Ended up modeling the card style layout after this.

Smoooth. Really liked how they presented the large icon first and faded the other ones in sequentially. Adapted these animations as well.

## Wireframe
*Working on getting this rotated properly*

Given the number of small details, I felt it was better to write out the wireframe on paper instead of using a tool like Balsamiq. Made sure there was ample amount of negative space to give each of the elements room to breath.

## Prototype

Used the OpenWeather API for the weather information and used the browser's built-in .getCurrentLocation() method for getlocation. Was a lot of fun writing the list transformations for the forecast data as well as iterating ont he animations until they felt right.
